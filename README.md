## hippieZhou

Hi! I'm hippie 🙋🏽‍♂️. By day I'm a software engineer, and by night I learn .NET Technology Stack 🙌🏽. Here's a gist about me:

* 📚 I taught myself .NET Core, C#, and XAML
* 📷 [I built the Wallpaper app on the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/attention-for-uwp/9nc82mfx4btz)

* 😅 I like C# as I love ❤️
